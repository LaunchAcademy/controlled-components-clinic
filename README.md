_"Oh bother, there seems to be a bit of fluff between my ears, for I cannot seem to remember what tasks I was supposed to do today. I'm sure they were important. Would be so kind as to help me keep a list of Pooh tasks? For I am a bear of very little brain, and I would ever so appreciate the help. "_

### Let's help Pooh with his Tasks

We'll need to create a task list react app to help manage this. To start, we'll just manage these tasks in state on the front end, but we can also try to persist this information in JSON files if we have time as well.

Before we begin, let's ponder on what components we will want in our component tree.

Remember, we can start by rendering just the presentational information first, and add in the eventListener functionality second.

Additionally, we have a few styles in our `style.css` to help us visualize the UI elements on the screen. We can optionally use these if we want to help Pooh understand the hierarchy of our React components.
